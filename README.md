# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview:
In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, the Math Library to generate a random choice, and conditionals to determine the winner.

- [x] Outside of your click handler, declare a randomNumber variable and set it equal to 0
- [x] In your click handler, generate a random number and assign it to the randomNumber variable
- [x] In your click handler, store the input value in a variable
- [x] In your click handler, display user input to the screen
#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

## JavaScript
- [x] Write a conditional statement which, given the number range of randomNumber, assigns ‘rock’, ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’ to the computer choice  variable
- [x] Display the computer choice to the screen
- [ ] Write a  statement that compares the userChoice to the computerChoice to determine the winner of the game
- [ ] Display the winner to the screen in a div
